# Got Lyrics?
## Overview
I built this app from scratch twice--once using vanilla JS, the other using React. The apps are nearly identical in both functionality and UI. I kept the UI simple, unfussy, and easy to read. The background is reminiscent of dark mode, but with a bit of personality. The perfect indie app for searching for your favorite indie lyrics.
